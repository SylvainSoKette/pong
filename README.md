# Pong

[Well, hello there !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc&t=8)

You probably know this game.

I just wanted to practice C for gamedev. This project will most likely evolve over time. I may end up doing some stupid stuff like make a render engine using Vulkan ?

## Dependencies

- SDL2

## How To Build

- run the ```./run``` script

OR

- ```make```
- ```bin/pong```
